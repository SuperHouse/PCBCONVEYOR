THIS IS VERY PRELIMINARY! I'm adding this work-in-progress to GitHub
so that Seon can access it, but it's not in a ready state for
general consumption.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A conveyor belt for linking together PCB assembly machines, includirg
pick-and-place, reflow, optical inspection, etc.

The width of the belt is adjustable to suit different sizes of PCBs
and panels.
